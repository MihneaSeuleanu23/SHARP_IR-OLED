# SHARP_IR-OLED
Arduino projects

The main purpose of this project is to familiarize with basic Arduino concepts and with soldering if you decide to get into more hardware things.
I used an Arduino Uno, a GP2Y0A60SZLF SHARP IR sensor with a Pololu carrier, a low-pass filter, some LEDs and a buzzer.
You can also try to make this project using a more OOP perspective...

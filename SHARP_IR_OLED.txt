Hi, everyone! This is a project that I created for my IoT(Internet of Things) path at MLSA UPB. With this project I learned various things about electronics
and overall it helped me develop skills that I do not encounter in faculty. 
Let's start with the beginning.


To do this project you will need:
-Arduino Uno with USB-B cable 
-breadboard
-male-male jumper wires
-three 5V leds (green,yellow,red)
-one piezzo buzzer
-resistors
-capacitors
-SHARP Infrared Sensor
-128x32 OLED Display

If you want to learn new skills, you can use a prototyping board, a soldering iron, solder and jumper wires. This way you can make the final size of the device 
much smaller, and without hanging wires.

But, then you might ask? What does this thing do?
Well, you might see it like a miniatural version of a car parking system and it works that way:
Based on the distance measured using sensor values, the LEDS will blink depending on the distance from the object and also the buzzer will start buzzing at 
different time intervals + the distance is shown on the display.

P.S. Instead of SHARP sensor you can use a more traditional HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor which I used in first step of the project but I didn't like it's 
FOV(Field of view).

Have fun! Don't stop learning!
